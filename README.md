### 🔗 [BMI CALCULATOR](https://github.com/SURESH8002/BMI-Calculator.git)
The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator is a digital health assessment tool designed to evaluate an individual's body weight relative to their height. It provides a quick and standardized method for categorizing weight status—underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese—based on widely accepted World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The calculator accepts user input in metric or imperial units and delivers immediate results, aiding in personal health awareness and risk assessment for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Commonly used in medical, fitness, and wellness applications, the BMI Calculator supports preventive healthcare initiatives by promoting informed lifestyle choices.
